            <h3>EDUCATION</h3>
            <p>I attended Murray High School in Murray, Kentucky. After graduation - and a lot of thought - 
                I made the decision to stay local and continued my education at Murray State University.
                In May of 2018 I received my B.S. degree in Engineering Physics.While working toward my degree, I played on the school's soccer team. Trying to balance school work
                while remaining in top condition for soccer was no easy task. Luckily, I had some great classmates, teammates,
                professors, and friends in my corner who helped me when I needed the help, and who pushed me when I needed 
                a push.</p>
                <p> I will forever be grateful for my time at Murray State University. Go Racers!</p>
